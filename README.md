This is the public repo for the Industry 4.0 DTM Course

## Assignment 1: Onboard vs Offboard Data Analytics

In this assignment, students use a Puck.js
device and a pre-trained ML model to classify device movements as one of three
gestures.


## Assignment 2: Gaze-based Augmented Reality

In this assignment, students gain experience working with gaze-based AR.
Concretely, students build a system that can learn how to estimate activities 
from eye tracking data and, following the activity recognition, can provide 
contextual suggestions on an AR display.
